                    After many years of twists and turns in my career and education - from dropping out of school after my freshman year of college, to spending several years working as a mechanic and a handyman, to finally returning to university as a Dean's list student - my journey in development began with a mandatory internship as part of my undergraduate degree. Before that internship I didn't really like programming and thought I might want to work in security. The focus of my internship was to crash course learning React.js and work with another developer to convert a C# application with an AWS backend to a React web application with a Firebase backend. By the end of that internship I was offered a job and knew I wanted to be a developer for the rest of my life. By the end of my first year, I knew that my real passion was in design and front-end development and I've never looked back since.
