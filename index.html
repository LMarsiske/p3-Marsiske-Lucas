                <p id="first_paragraph">
                    After many years of twists and turns in my career and education - from dropping out of school after my freshman year of college, to spending several years working as a mechanic and a handyman, to finally returning to university as a Dean's list student - my journey in development began with a mandatory internship as part of my undergraduate degree. Before that internship I didn't really like programming and thought I might want to work in security. The focus of my internship was to crash course learning React.js and work with another developer to convert a C# application with an AWS backend to a React web application with a Firebase backend. By the end of that internship I was offered a job and knew I wanted to be a developer for the rest of my life. By the end of my first year, I knew that my real passion was in design and front-end development and I've never looked back since.

                <p id="second_paragraph">
                    As a developer, I try to use my diverse background to inform what I do. I want to make things that work for the people that have to use them, no matter where they're coming from.

                        <p>
                            I enjoy designing for both print and digital mediums. My previous work has ranged from trade show booth banners to business cards to digital brochures for non-profits. I also do some logo design as well as photo editing.

                            My most recent work has been with the MammaCare foundation, a non-profit focused on training medical professionals to perform clinical breast exams for the early detection of breast cancer. My work has focused on rebuilding their old C# desktop training application as a React.js web application. Unfortunately, most of this site is not publicly available, but the screenshot to the right will take you the public landing page so you can get some idea of the end result.
